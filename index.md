All crafts from the business side to management to trainers. The communities band together, network, teach and grow. GRDevHQ aims to build an all inclusive
Developer community. One that hopes to transgress rifts and divides. We welcome all developers irrespective of tech stack, backend, front end UI, choice of vendor or any other divide.

Patrick McKenzie can be credited for stating:

> "Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it." - Patrick McKenzie

**This does not mean that you must face this challenge alone.** We will band together share, mentor and provide solutions. Visit the forums, post questions, read texts, and interact.

Welcome Home!
